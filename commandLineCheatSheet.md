# Command Line Cheat Sheet

## Introduction
---

**Terminal**, **Git**, and **GitHub** are important tools software engineers use on a daily basis. Most (regular) users interact with computers using the GUI (graphic user interface) which is already built in to their operating sytem. Essentially, this means they can look through their files, open and create folders, etc. by simply clicking with their cursor. However, programmers use the command line (a.k.a the console, shell, or CLI), whereby commands are typed into a text terminal to tell the computer what to do directly. Although it takes time to learn, once you get the hang of it, this method saves so much time and is worth learning.
